Flume cassandra no good integrations
=> plugins unmaintained
=> rip

DBs need processing jobs in order to digest from kafka

Docker images are not that used? Newer thing that can help development when this logic is decoupled from the OS

Big data europe has made docker containers for hadoop ecosystem

Uses traefik which is not needed

Kafka does not have easy ways to create topic
=> most production ready way is to use AdminAPI and create a new application

Kafka has no web ui to check what is up
=> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49276785/monitoring-ui-for-apache-kafka-kafka-manager-vs-kafka-monitor/49292872
=> TL;DR not many "good" non-commercial solutions


Errors while developing
- Cache problems => Errors that made no sense (file corruption)
- Not enough memory => Silently killing processess (scala)
- Kafka connect => Worker is killed but process continues
  - Namenode did not have enough time to setup => inf while loop to ping namenode
  - Connection error: Protocol message end-group tag did not match expected tag. => wrong port (right port 9000)
  - Wrong serializer => JSON when actually String needed
  - Cannot read files from HDFS 
  - org.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: already open => flush size set to 1 with one partition https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-hdfs/issues/298

TODO problems:
- HDFS permission do not allow web ui file downloads
