\chapter{Environment}
\label{chapter:environment}

%A problem instance is rarely totally independent of its environment.
%Most often you need to describe the environment you work in, what
%limits there are and so on. This is a good place to do that. Sometimes
%the environment is described together with your own implemantation, in
%the same chapter. Here, we first tell you about the LaTeX working
%environments and then we have an example from an thesis written some years
%ago.
